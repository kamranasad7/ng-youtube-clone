    It’s finally happened… We’ve got our hands on a Koenigsegg for a carwow drag race!! 
    
    We’ve got Mat lining up in the Koenigsegg Agera RST, and he’s about to go head-to-head against a Tesla Model S PLAID and a supercharged Suzuki Hayabusa! 
    
    So let’s see how these three monsters compare, and of course, we’ve got to start with the Koenigsegg! It’s powered by an incredible 5-litre twin-turbo V8 that delivers an eye-watering 1,360kg and 1,573Nm of torque. It’s equipped with a 7-speed dual-clutch gearbox and sends all of its power to the rear wheels. It’s also super light, tipping the scales at 1,395kg, and it’s easily the most expensive car Mat has ever drag-raced, with an estimated value of £3,500,000!! 
    
    Alongside it, we have the Tesla Model S Plaid. It’s equipped with three motors, and they combine to put down 1,020hp and 1,420Nm, with all of this power being sent to all four wheels. Naturally, being electric, it’s weighed down a bit by the batteries and motors, and as a result, it weighs in at 2,190kg. 
    
    Then finally we have the Hayabusa. But this is no usual Suzuki Hayabusa! It’s had a supercharger fitted to it, and as a result, its 1.3-litre 4-cylinder engine produces 385hp and 280Nm of torque! This power is sent to the rear wheels, and of course, it’s oh-so light, weighing in at 257kg. 
    
    So how will this one play out - will the electric power of the Tesla propel it to victory? Or will either the Koenigsegg or Hayabusa sneak it? There’s only one way to find out… LET’S RACE!
